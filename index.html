        <p>
          We are a small group of individuals based in the Oakland, CA area who support the #BLM #blacklivesmatter protests and also support measures to limit the spread of COVID-19. Given the impracticality of social distancing while protesting in person, we would like to help support the cause by distributing PPE protesters can use (like cloth masks/face shields) for usage while protests continue. <b>We are NOT healthcare professionals and recommend visiting the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/using-ppe.html">CDC</a> website for guidance on PPE and usage of it.</b>

          We handed out 16 3-D printed face shields at the protest held in Oakland at 12:00 PM PST at the Oakland Police Department on 7th and Broadway with the following information attached to each face shield for further reading.
